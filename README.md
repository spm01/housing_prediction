Hi everyone! This is my first project dealing with prediction rather than causal inference. 

I participated in a Kaggle competition that compares the RMSE (Root Square Mean Deviation) from my test data with true data. 

I started by initially, my RMSE was high, but I made the choice to convert all NA values to the mean of the variable. This significantly dropped my RMSE, from around 0.5 to around 0.17.

I decided to use a linear model for this competition rather more complicated models, but if I was to participate again, I would like to use a Random Forest to shrink my RMSE.

Please let me know if you have any questions! Also, the PDF has the cleanest formattiing.
